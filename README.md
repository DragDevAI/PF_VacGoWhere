# Vacation Go Where
This project aims to create a simple app-page to provide users with helpful information about the travel destination of their choice.

## Design Process
The website is targeted to travellers who have no time to study the intended destination of their choice. By providing the users some information about the destination, we hope that the users would find it useful for their selection process. We start with the ten most popular destination for Singaporeans (based on Yahoo rankings), in the future, we may expand the scope to include more destinations.

We aim big, the intention is to create a one-stop-shop suite for travellers.

## Features
The site locates user by checking their IP address (no cheating please!), from which we generate a "base" from where users travel. The base is useful to, for example, determine the base currency for the exchange rate (with the currency of the destination). In the future the app may recommend users to book air-ticket and/or hotel, partnering with service providers in between the base and the destination.

Future feature will also include input from user on their intended time of travel, from which the app provides historical weather information of the destination on the selected month of travelling.

## Technologies Used
We are minion coders who have just started, so basic HTML, CCS and JavaScript together with API are used in this app.

Graphical images were rendered by the open source [HTML Charts - chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

## Testing
We did try our best.

VacGoWhere
This project aims to create a simple app-page to provide users with helpful information about the travel destination of their choice.

Design Process
The website is targeted to travellers who have no time to study the intended destination of their choice. By providing the users some information about the destination, we hope that the users would find it useful for the selection process. We start with the ten most popular destination for Singaporeans (based on Yahoo rankings), in the future, we may expand the scope to include more destinations.

We aim big, the intention is to create a one-stop-shop suite for travellers.

Features
The site locates user by checking their IP address (no cheating please!), from which we generate a "base" from where users travel. The base is useful to, for example, determine the base currency for the exchange rate (with the currency of the destination). In the future the app may recommend users to book air-ticket and/or hotel, partnering with service providers in between the base and the destination.

Future feature will also include input from user on their intended time of travel, from which the app provides weather forecast information of the destination on the proposed date of travelling.

Technologies Used
We are minion coders who have just started, so basic HTML, CCS and JavaScript together with API are used in this app.

Testing
Very painful

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
